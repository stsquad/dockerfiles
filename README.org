* Intro

#+BEGIN_VERSE
These are my Dockerfiles,
There are many like them but these are mine,
My Dockerfiles are my friends,
I must master them as I must master my life,
Without me they are useless, [fn:1]
Without them I am useless, [fn:2]
#+END_VERSE

[fn:1] They do sometimes hard code my user id in them
[fn:2] Hopefully not that useless ;-)

* Layout

There is one docker recipe per directory. Some recipes require a
previous layer to be built. For example:

#+name: building-cross-environment
#+header: :results output
#+begin_src sh 
 cd distros/debian-bullseye/
  ../../build.sh
 cd ../../crossbuild/bullseye-arm64/
 ../../build.sh
#+end_src

there is no magic orchestration to do this so look at the Dockerfile.

* Building

The [[file:build.sh][build script]] is super dumb and basically just works out a tag for
the image and sets a few arguments. Because it snarfs details from uid
it expects to be running the docker tools as the user. Typically this
means you need to be a member of the `docker` group.
