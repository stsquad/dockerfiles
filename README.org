* Intro

#+BEGIN_VERSE
These are my Dockerfiles,
There are many like them but these are mine,
My Dockerfiles are my friends,
I must master them as I must master my life,
Without me they are useless, [fn:1]
Without them I am useless, [fn:2]
#+END_VERSE

[fn:1] They do sometimes hard code my user id in them
[fn:2] Hopefully not that useless ;-)

* Layout

There is one docker recipe per directory.

* Building

The [[file:build.sh][build script]] is super dumb and basically just works out a tag for
the image and sets a few arguments. Because it snarfs details from uid
it expects to be running the docker tools as the user. Typically this
means you need to be a member of the `docker` group.
